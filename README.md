# Diabetes Prediction using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
# Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using TensorFlow and Keras to predict whether a person has diabetes based on medical diagnostic measurements.

The project uses the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, which contains medical attributes and a target variable indicating diabetes outcome.

Project Workflow

# 1. Data Loading

The dataset is loaded using Pandas.

data = pd.read_csv('/diabetes.csv')

The dataset contains medical predictor variables and one output variable.

# 2. Data Preprocessing

Neural networks perform better when the data is properly preprocessed.

Steps Performed
Checked missing values
Split features and target variables
Performed train-test split
Applied feature scaling using StandardScaler
Feature Scaling Formula

Standardization transforms data using:

z=
σ
x−μ
	​

x
μ
σ
z=
σ
x−μ
	​

≈1.2
Φ(z)≈88.5%

Where:

x = original value
μ = mean
σ = standard deviation
3. Model Architecture

The ANN model is built using the Keras Sequential API.

# Architecture
Input Layer → 8 input features
Hidden Layer 1 → 12 neurons with ReLU activation
Hidden Layer 2 → 8 neurons with ReLU activation
Output Layer → 1 neuron with Sigmoid activation

# 5. Training the Model

The ANN model is trained for 100 epochs using the training dataset.

history = model.fit(
    X_train,
    y_train,
    epochs=100,
    batch_size=10
)

# During training:

Loss gradually decreases
Accuracy improves with each epoch
# 6. Model Evaluation

The trained model is evaluated using the test dataset.

loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
Model Performance
Loss: 0.5896
Accuracy: 73.37%
7. Predictions

The model predicts whether a patient has diabetes or not.

y_pred_prob = model.predict(X_test)

Predictions are converted into binary labels:

Probability ≥ 0.5 → Diabetes
Probability < 0.5 → No Diabetes
